# ATM PROJECT:
#
# You need to create an ATM application.
#
# THE ATM SUPPORTS THE FOLLOWING OPERATIONS: DEPOSITS,
# WITHDRAWALS, CHECK BALANCE AND QUIT.
#
# THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS:
#
#
0. Save several customers in the system 3 like (user1, user2, user3)
with different pin codes and different names and
balances for example (&#39;Avi Cohen&#39;, 1234 , 1000), (&#39;Yossi Cohen&#39;, 6543 , 500) , (&#39;Yuri Levi&#39;, 5852, 800) .
1. Asks the user to input his/her name or (which will have a first name and a last name on it);
2. GREETS THE USER &quot;Welcome to Avi Cohen&quot;
3. Asks the user for her/his pin code (pincode are 4 digits,
need to check if it is correct )
4. Also need to check if it was the users correct pincode
5. IF everything went ok, the user gets a new greeting with the
following options:
&quot;ATM MENU:&quot;
&quot;Press button d to Deposit Money&quot;
&quot;Press button w to Withdraw Money&quot;
&quot;Press button c to Check your Balance&quot;;
&quot;Press button q to Quit&quot;;
Bonus option: &quot;Press button p to change PIN_CODE&quot;
Bonus option: &quot;Press button R to create RECIPE&quot;
explained in the 11 section.
6. If the user pressed &quot;d&quot; the following menu will appear:
&quot;How much would you like to Deposit?&quot;
it will get the amount from the user and add it to the Balance.
**need to check if the amount is a multiplier of 20 50
or 100 (Because 20 is the lowest bill you can use in ISRAEL)
** for example I cannot deposit 352 because - 300 is fine + 50 is fine

but 2 - can&#39;t;
Will print out &quot;OK&quot; or some other conformation and
Then it will get the user back to the &quot;ATM MENU&quot; screen.

7. If the user pressed &quot;w&quot; following menu will appear:
&quot;How much would you like to Withdraw?&quot;
&quot;1 - 50 , 2 - 100 , 3 - 150, 4 - 300, 5 - other &quot;
If pressed &quot;1&quot; 50 will be subtracted from the current Balance amount
same with &quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot; and &quot;4&quot;;
But if pressed &quot;5&quot; will be prompt to give own amount and that
amount will be subtracted from the current Balance amount.
** Balance cannot go to minus , need to check the subtracted is
possible (if you have enough money)
** If not need to say &quot;sorry, operation could not happen,
you don&#39;t have enough Balance for this operation&quot;
If everything was alright print out &quot;OK&quot; or some other confirmation and
Then it will get the user back to the &quot;ATM MENU&quot; screen.

8. If the user pressed &quot;c&quot; it will show his/hers balance
for example &quot;Your current Balance is 950 NIS&quot;.
Then it will get the user back to the &quot;ATM MENU&quot; screen.
9. If the user pressed &quot;q&quot; it will print out &quot;GOODBYE AVI, HAVE A NICE DAY&quot;
10. The project has to use loops, lists, function
11. Bonus Points - Challenge:
1.&quot;Implementing p option to change the pin_code of the Customer to use in the next login to the
ATM (need to # check if it actually works, try to login with it)&quot;
2.&quot;Implementing R option to print the data of the customer
such as Name and LastName and the current balance of this/hers account &quot;
Example: &quot;&quot;&quot;
Hello Avi Cohen,
At this moment DATE: 01/03/23 10:00:00 you got 1000 NIS in you account
