<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<a id="about-the-project"></a>

## About The Project 📝

An interactive console-based ATM application that allows users to perform essential banking operations, including deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and account management.
The system supports multiple predefined users with unique PIN codes and balances.
Users can securely log in, navigate an intuitive menu, and perform transactions with built-in validation to ensure proper cash handling.
The ATM enforces rules such as deposit multipliers (20, 50, or 100) and withdrawal limits based on available balance.
Additionally, advanced features include PIN code updates and a receipt generation option, enhancing user experience.
The project is structured using loops, lists, and functions for efficient program flow.
